        <h2>History of the Business</h2>
        <img src="images/history.jpeg" alt="history of the business" class="History">
        <p>Empowering the Nation was founded by Precious Radebe in 2018, inspired by her parents' personal experiences and struggles as unskilled workers. 
            Growing up, Precious witnessed firsthand the challenges her parents faced due to a lack of access to formal education and skills development programs. 
            This ignited her passion to create a business that could uplift people in similar situations, providing them with opportunities to learn, grow, 
            and improve their quality of life. The business started in a small community center, offering basic life skills training to a handful of people, but 
            has since grown into a well-respected institution, helping thousands across the region</p>

            <p>What began as a humble initiative has now expanded into a fully-fledged skills development program, offering courses in First Aid, Sewing, Gardening, 
                and more. Empowering the Nation continues to evolve, constantly adding new training modules that address the growing needs of domestic workers and gardeners.</p>

        <h2>Empowering the Nation</h2>
        <p>Precious Radebe started "Empowering the Nation" to address a critical gap in society: the lack of accessible, quality training for domestic workers 
            and gardeners. These individuals, often overlooked in traditional education systems, are the backbone of many households, yet they rarely have opportunities 
            to enhance their skill sets. Precious wanted to create an organization that would not only offer them essential skills but also give them the confidence 
            and knowledge to improve their lives and financial security</p>

            <p>Today, Empowering the Nation offers a wide variety of practical courses, from First Aid and Cooking to Childcare and Garden Maintenance. 
                These programs are designed to be affordable and accessible, ensuring that every participant leaves with valuable skills they can immediately put to use in their jobs.</p>                
            
            <p>Since its inception, the business has empowered over 5,000 domestic workers and gardeners, helping them to become more skilled, employable, and self-reliant. 
                With a dedicated team of instructors, the organization continues to expand its outreach, now partnering with local businesses and communities to increase 
                the scope of its services.</p>

        <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
        <p>The mission of Empowering the Nation is to uplift and improve the lives of domestic workers and gardeners by providing high-quality, affordable, 
            and accessible skills training. We are committed to enhancing the employability, dignity, and personal growth of every individual who participates in our programs. 
            By equipping them with essential skills, we empower them to take charge of their future and improve their overall quality of life.</p>

            <p>Our vision is to create a society where every domestic worker and gardener has the opportunity to develop their skills, achieve financial independence, 
                and secure a better future for themselves and their families. We aim to become the leading organization in South Africa for domestic skills training, 
                recognized for our innovation, commitment to excellence, and positive social impact.</p>
                
                <p>At Empowering the Nation, we believe that education is a powerful tool for change. We strive to break the cycle of poverty by providing skills that 
                are not only valuable in the workplace but also in daily life. Our goal is to create a ripple effect, where the individuals we train can pass on their 
                knowledge to others, further empowering communities across the country.</p>
